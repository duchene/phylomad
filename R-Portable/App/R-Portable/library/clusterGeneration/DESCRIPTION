Description: We developed the clusterGeneration package to provide functions 
        for generating random clusters, generating random 
        covariance/correlation matrices,
        calculating a separation index (data and population version)
        for pairs of clusters or cluster distributions, and 1-D and 2-D
        projection plots to visualize clusters.  The package also
        contains a function to generate random clusters based on
        factorial designs with factors such as degree of separation,
        number of clusters, number of variables, number of noisy
        variables.
