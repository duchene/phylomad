 NEWS for fastmatch
--------------------

1.1-0	(under development)
    o	add fmatch.hash() which will create a hash table that can
	be used later with fmatch(). This can be used in cases where
	attaching the hash to the table implicitly is not reliable.

    o	added ctapply() - a fast version of tapply()

    o	added coalesce() - fast way of grouping unique values into
	contiguous groups (in linear time).

    o	added %fin% - a fast version of %in%

    o	fastmatch now supports long vectors. Note that the hash
	function is the same as in R and thus it uses at most 32-bits,
	hence long vectors can be used, but they must have less than
	2^32 (~4e9) unique values.

    o	bugfix: matching reals against a table that contains NA or NaNs
	would not match the position of those but return NA instead.

    o	bugfix: fix crash when a newly unserialized hash table is
	used (since the table hash is not stored during serialization).


1.0-4	2012-01-12
    o	some R functions (such as subset assignment like x[1] <- 2)
	can create a new object (with possibly modified content) and
	copy all attributes including the hash cache. If the original
	object was used as a table in fmatch(), the hash cache will be
	copied into the modified object and thus its cache will be
	possibly out of	sync with the object. fmatch() will now
	identify such cases and discard the hash to prevent errorneous
	results.

1.0-3	2011-12-21
    o	match() coerces POSIXlt objects into characters, but so far 
	fmatch() performed the match on the actual objects.
	Now fmatch() coerces POSIXlt object into characters just like
	match(), but note that you will lose the ability to perform
	fast lookups if the table is a POSIXlt object -- please use
	POSIXct objects (much more efficient) or use as.character() on
	the POSIXlt object to create a table that you want to re-use.

1.0-2	2011-09-14
    o	bugfix: nomatch was ignored in the fastmatch implementation
	(thanks to Enrico Schumann for reporting)

1.0-1	2010-12-23
    o	minor cleanups

1.0-0	2010-12-23
    o	initial release
